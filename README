### `fast-sql-import.sh`

Optimizes and simplifies the process of importing large `.sql` files.

- Applies temporary MySQL performance tweaks (e.g., disables foreign key checks, increases buffer sizes)
- Presents a menu to select an `.sql` file and target database
- Supports `.sql` files compressed with `.gz`
- Restores original MySQL settings after import

**Use case:** When you frequently import large MySQL dumps for development or testing and want a faster, safer workflow.

- Runs tools like:
  - [Pest](https://pestphp.com/) â€” testing framework
  - [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/) â€” static analysis
- Designed to be flexible and extensible for local or CI-like usage

**Use case:** Quickly spin up a test/analysis pipeline on any Git repository without installing PHP or dependencies locally.
